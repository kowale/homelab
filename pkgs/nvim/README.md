# Nvim

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

## Usage

- `s` for full buffer Leap search
- `ff`, `fg`, `fo` for Telescope
- `,,`, `,a` for Harpoon
- `Enter` to select out
- `Backspace` to select back in

## Todo

- Open a buffer at visual selection
  with editable and executable
  bash script and hook to rerun on write
