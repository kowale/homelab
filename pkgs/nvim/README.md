# Nvim

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

## Usage

- `C-t` for terminal
- `C-T` for Trouble quickfix list
- `s` for visible buffer Leap search
- `ff`, `fg`, `fo`, `fb` for Telescope
- `,,`, `,a`, `,1` for Harpoon
- `Enter` to select outer TS node and
  `Backspace` to select inner TS node

## Todo

- At visual selection, open new tabbed buffer
  containing editable and executable script
  that runs whenever the source file changes.
- Open an `.md` file,
  run through `cmark` and open in Firefox.
  Rerun on source file changes.
